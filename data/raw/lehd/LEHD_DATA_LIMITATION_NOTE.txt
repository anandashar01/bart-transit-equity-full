LEHD LODES DATA LIMITATION FOR BERKELEY ANALYSIS
=================================================

FINDING: LEHD data CANNOT be used for Berkeley transit ridership analysis

REASON:
-------
LEHD LODES only captures 25,970 jobs in Berkeley (2019), but Berkeley actually
has 100,000+ jobs. The discrepancy is because:

1. UC Berkeley (~40,000 employees) is largely EXCLUDED
   - May be classified as federal employer due to research contracts
   - LEHD only covers private sector + state/local government

2. Federal employees excluded entirely

3. Self-employed, contractors, gig workers excluded

4. Graduate student workers may not be counted

IMPACT ON ANALYSIS:
-------------------
- LEHD shows jobs INCREASED 2019→2021 (25,970 → 38,524)
- Reality: Jobs DECREASED due to UC Berkeley going remote + downtown office closures
- LEHD completely misses the UC Berkeley remote work transition
- This was the PRIMARY driver of BART ridership collapse

CONCLUSION:
-----------
DO NOT use LEHD data for missing riders analysis.

Our current approach (news reports + BART ridership data + population statistics)
is MORE ACCURATE than LEHD for this specific case because it captures the
UC Berkeley effect.

LEHD would be useful for:
- General commute pattern analysis in areas without major federal employers
- Small-scale neighborhood commute analysis
- Comparing typical employment centers

But NOT for Berkeley 2019-2021 where UC Berkeley remote work was the key story.
